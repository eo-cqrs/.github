OOP components, which try to reduce the complexity of microservices architecture.
<br>
Built on top of the strong Software Development Process best practices and Object-Oriented principles:

`1. Simplicity is a virtue`
<br>
`2. No monolithic repositories`
<br>
`3. No manual deployments`
<br>
`4. Master branch is read-only`
<br>
`5. No DI Containers`
<br>
`6. All objects are immutable`
<br>
`7. Logic is scaling horizontally among objects`

<br>

Here are the components around [EO-CQRS](https://eo-cqrs.github.io/.github) including:

* [/eo-events](https://github.com/eo-cqrs/eo-events) is a collection of objects for handling Events

* [/eo-kafka](https://github.com/eo-cqrs/eo-kafka) is Kafka Producers and consumers for working with Apache Kafka
  message broker

* [/xfake](https://github.com/eo-cqrs/xfake) is an XML In-Memory Storage for elegant Mocking
